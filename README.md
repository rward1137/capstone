html work for a community watch web app

So I'm making the pages for our site in html, but they're really going to be java server pages that work with servlets an msSQL database. 

could you help me figure out how to get the places API to autocomplete the home address bar of the login.html page under register??

I can't get the suggestions to pop up, and I usually get an error message in the text field that says "something went wrong" haha. 

Thanks for your help, Nick. I really appreciate it.
